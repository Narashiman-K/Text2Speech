## React Component

The React component which implements the PSPDFKit for Web integration can be found at `src/components/PdfViewerComponent.jsx`.

In order to make the PSPDFKit SDK assets available they have to be copied from the `node_modules/pspdfkit/dist` folder to `public/pspdfkit-lib` folder. For that purpose this example uses a copy plugin which you can find at `vite.config.js`.
